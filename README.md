# DDStateMachine
Loosely based interpretation of the old and well-known state machine

## Requirements

- iOS 10.3+
- Xcode 9.4+
- Swift 4.1+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate DDStateMachine into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "DeadDogDeus/DDStateMachine" ~> 1.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `DDStateMachine.framework` into your Xcode project.
